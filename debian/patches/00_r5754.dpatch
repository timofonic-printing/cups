 ------------------------
 
+CHANGES IN CUPS V1.2.2
+
+	- Documentation updates (STR #1765, STR #1780)
+	- CUPS didn't know about alternate character set names
+	  for Asian text (STR #1819)
+	- The lpoptions -o and -r options did not work unless you
+	  specified a printer.
+	- The lpoptions command incorrectly allowed users to set
+	  printer attributes like printer-type (STR #1791)
+	- httpWait() did not flush the write buffer, causing "bad
+	  request" errors when communicating with CUPS 1.1.x
+	  servers (STR #1717)
+	- Polling did not sanitize the printer description,
+	  location, or make and model strings like broadcasts

+	- Polled printers did not show the server's default
+	  job-sheets option value.
+	- The Samba password prompt was not properly localized
+	  (STR #1814)
+	- Added a German translation (STR #1842)
+	- The scheduler now creates self-signed SSL certficates
+	  automatically when using OpenSSL and CDSA for
+	  encryption, just as for GNU TLS.
+	- The SNMP backend sporatically reported some printers as
+	  "unknown" (STR #1774)
+	- The scheduler now forces BrowseTimeout to be at least
+	  twice the BrowseInterval value and non-zero to avoid
+	  common configuration errors.
+	- The scheduler incorrectly returned printer URIs of the
+	  form "ipp://server/printers/classname" for classes (STR
+	  #1813)
+	- Updated Japanese localization (STR #1805)
+	- The scheduler's SSL certificate/key directory was not
+	  created on installation (STR #1788)
+	- Added a mailto.conf man page and help page (STR #1754)
+	- The parallel and USB backends no longer wait for the
+	  printer to go on-line - this caused problems with
+	  certain printers that don't follow with the IEEE-1284
+	  standard (STR #1738)
+	- The scheduler could crash on a reload when implicit
+	  classes were present (STR #1828)
+	- The IPP backend incorrectly used the CUPS_ENCRYPTION
+	  environment variable to determine the default
+	  encryption mode when printing (STR #1820)
+	- USB printing did not work on Solaris (STR #1756)
+	- The scheduler sorted job priorities in the wrong order
+	  (STR #1811)
+	- The scheduler did not automatically restart notifiers
+	  that exited or crashed (STR #1793)
+	- IPv6 support did not work on NetBSD (STR #1834)
+	- The EPM packaging file did not work (STR #1804)
+	- The scheduler used up the CPU if BrowseRemoteProtocols
+	  was empty (STR #1792)
+	- Custom page sizes did not work (STR #1787)
+	- The SNMP backend could crash on some systems when SNMP
+	  logging was enabled (STR #1789)
+	- Browsing could produce some funny printer names when
+	  ServerName was set to an IP address (STR #1799)
+	- Fixed the log message for BrowseRelay (STR #1798)
+	- Fixes to allow CUPS to compile on MirBSD (STR #1796)
+	- The scheduler incorrectly set the FINAL_CONTENT_TYPE
+	  environment variable (STR #1795)
+	- The pdftops filter incorrectly embedded a "produced by"
+	  comment, causing PDF printing not to work on some
+	  operating systems (STR #1801)
+	- Sending raw jobs from a client system could cause the
+	  client's scheduler to eventually crash (STR #1786)
+	- The scheduler now checks that the notifier exists prior
+	  to accepting a new subscription request.
+	- The scheduler now reports the supported
+	  notify-recipient schemes based on the contents of the
+	  ServerBin/notifier directory.
+	- Event notifications did not include the
+	  notify-sequence-number or other required attributes
+	  (STR #1747)
+	- Allow/Deny addresses of the form "11.22.33.*" did not
+	  work on Linux (STR #1769)
+	- cupsGetPPD() did not work if the scheduler was only
+	  listening on a domain socket (STR #1766)
+	- The scheduler could crash advertising a class (STR
+	  #1768)
+	- The scheduler could crash if the default printer was
+	  deleted (STR #1776)
+	- Added a new default CUPS raster format (v3) which does
+	  not compress the raster stream in order to provide the
+	  same cupsRasterReadPixels() and cupsRasterWritePixels()
+	  performance as CUPS 1.1.x.
+	- The cupsaddsmb man page listed the wrong files for the
+	  CUPS driver.
+	- Some configure --with options did not work (STR #1746)
+	- "Allow @IF(name)" didn't work if "name" wasn't the
+	  first network interface (STR #1758)
+	- The lpstat command did not use the correct character
+	  set when reporting the date and time (STR #1751)
+	- The cupsaddsmb command and web interface did not update
+	  the Windows PPD files properly, resulting in corrupt
+	  PPD files for the Windows client to use (STR #1750)
+	- The cupsd.conf man page didn't describe the Listen
+	  domain socket syntax (STR #1753)
+	- The scheduler no longer tries to support more than
+	  FD_SETSIZE file descriptors.
+	- CDSA (encryption) support fixes for MacOS X.
+	- The lppasswd program needs to be setuid to root to
+	  create and update the /etc/cups/passwd.md5 file (STR
+	  #1735)
+	- 32/64-bit library installation was broken (STR #1741)
+	- The USB backend now reports a "no such device" error
+	  when using the old filename-based USB URIs instead of
+	  the "success" error.
+	- Increased the HTTP and IPP read timeouts to 10 seconds,
+	  as 1 second was too short on congested networks (STR
+	  #1719)
+	- The SNMP backend now uses the device description over
+	  the printer-make-and-model attribute when the attribute
+	  contains a generic name (STR #1728)
+	- Fixed another file descriptor leak when printing raw
+	  files (STR #1736)
+	- Raw queues were not shared via LDAP (STR #1739)
+	- The pstops filter didn't always embed PageSetup
+	  commands from the PPD file (STR #1740)
+	- "make install" didn't work if you disabled all of the
+	  localizations.
+	- The scheduler didn't always choose the least costly
+	  filter.
+	- Fixed parsing of IPv6 addresses in Allow, Deny,
+	  BrowseAllow, BrowseDeny, and BrowseRelay directives
+	  (STR #1713)
+	- Printers that were shared via LDAP did not get added to
+	  the LDAP server properly (STR #1733)
+	- LDAP browsing would crash the scheduler if a required
+	  value was missing (STR #1731)
+	- Special cases for the "localhost" hostname did not
+	  work, causing printing to not work when the /etc/hosts
+	  file did not contain a localhost entry (STR #1723)
+	- Updated the Spanish translation (STR #1720, STR #1770)
+	- Reverse-order page output was broken when N-up or
+	  landscape orientations were used (STR #1725)
+	- The parallel, serial, socket, and USB backends needed
+	  print data before they would report back-channel data,
+	  causing problems with several new drivers (STR #1724)
+
+
 CHANGES IN CUPS V1.2.1
 
+	- "lprm -h hostname" did not work (STR #1800)
 	- The web interface did not handle reloads properly for
 	  MSIE (STR #1716)
 	- The configure script no longer adds linker rpath

-Preliminary Design for CUPS Firewire Printer Backend - 03/19/2002
------------------------------------------------------------------
-
-OVERVIEW
-
-    Easy Software Products will develop an IEEE-1394, a.k.a.
-    Firewire, printing interface for its Common UNIX Printing
-    System ("CUPS") for initial use under the Linux operating
-    system.  A follow-on implementation for MacOS X is
-    anticipated as well.
-
-    The operating system interfaces for IEEE-1394 ports vary
-    widely; the CUPS printing interface will abstract the OS
-    layer to a simpler interface geared towards discovering,
-    opening, reading from, writing to, and closing IEEE-1394
-    printers.
-
-    The initial development of the CUPS backend will be targeted
-    at the EPSON Stylus Pro 10000 large format printer, which
-    requires the bandwidth provided by Firewire in order to
-    print at full speed.  This printer supports printing via
-    Serial Bus Protocol 2 (SBP-2) using the SCSI and PWG command
-    sets. The CUPS backend will implement the PWG command set on
-    LUN 0 only.
-
-
-OS ABSTRACTION LAYER
-
-    The OS abstraction layer will be a thin client library that
-    implements the following functions:
-
-        ieee1394_list
-	ieee1394_open
-	ieee1394_close
-	ieee1394_read
-	ieee1394_write
-	ieee1394_error
-
-    The "ieee1394_list" function will list all of the available
-    printer devices on the bus.  The device information will
-    consist of the device URI (ieee1394:/something) used to
-    access the device and the make and model information, if
-    available, for the device ("EPSON Stylus Printer").
-
-    The "ieee1394_open" and "ieee1394_close" functions will open
-    and close a connection to the printer, respectively.
-
-    The "ieee1394_read" and "ieee1394_write" functions will read
-    and write data to and from the printer, respectively.  The
-    read function will be non-blocking, returning data only if
-    there is data coming back from the printer.
-
-    The "ieee1394_error" function will return a string
-    describing the last error or NULL if no error occurred.
-
-    The library will be responsible for creating any background
-    threads that are needed to monitor the connection to the
-    printer.
-
-
-CUPS BACKEND
-
-    The CUPS backend will use the OS abstraction layer to list
-    and access the Firewire printers.  The "main" function will
-    read and write printer data, while the "list_devices"
-    function will be called as necessary to identify the
-    available devices.
-
-    The CUPS 1.1 backend will record any status information in
-    the error log file, while the 1.2 backend will supply it to
-    the printer driver process.

-Subject: EPSON Firewire Printer Driver for Linux
-
-Currently, no Firewire printer support exists for Linux.  Since
-the latest EPSON printer products depend on the Firewire
-interface to print at full speed, a solution is needed to
-support customers using Linux as their server platform.
-
-The Linux Firewire subsystem provides a user-mode driver
-interface that allows driver programs to access Firewire
-devices.  Easy Software Products will utilize this interface to
-develop a "backend" program for the Common UNIX Printing System
-that will allow users to print to EPSON printers using the
-Firewire interface.
-
-After examining the Linux interface, we estimate that it will
-require approximately 30 hours of development time to write,
-test, and document the Firewire backend, for a total cost of
-$3,000. The new backend will become a standard part of the CUPS
-software distribution and will be included with at least the
-following Linux distributions:
-
-    - Caldera Linux
-    - Mandrake Linux
-    - Red Hat Linux
-    - SuSE Linux

+	<TITLE>Managing Operation Policies</TITLE>
+</HEAD>
+<BODY>
+
+<P>Operation policies are the rules used for each IPP operation
+in CUPS. These rules include things like "user must provide a
+password", "user must be in the system group", "allow only from
+the local system", and so forth. Until CUPS 1.2, these rules were
+largely hardcoded and could only be customized at a very basic
+level.</P>
+
+<P>CUPS 1.2 adds a new fine-grained policy layer which allows you
+to completely redefine the rules for each operation and/or
+printer. Each policy is named and defines access control rules
+for each IPP operation. This document describes how to manage
+policies and their rules.</P>
+
+<H2 CLASS="title"><A NAME="BASICS">The Basics</A></H2>
+
+<P>Operation policies are used for all IPP requests sent to the
+scheduler and are evaluated <em>after</em> the <A
+HREF="ref-cupsd-conf.html#Location"><TT>Location</TT></A> based
+access control rules. This means that operation policies can only
+add additional security restrictions to a request, never relax
+them. Use <TT>Location</TT> based access control rules for
+server-wide limits and operation policies for limits on
+individual printers, tasks, or services.</P>
+
+<P>Policies are stored in the <VAR>cupsd.conf</VAR> file in <A
+HREF="ref-cupsd-conf.html#Policy"><TT>Policy</TT></A> sections.
+Each policy has an alphanumeric name that is used to select it.
+Inside the policy section are one or more <A
+HREF="ref-cupsd-conf.html#LimitIPP"><TT>Limit</TT></A>
+subsections which list the operations that are affected by the
+rules inside it. <A HREF="#LISTING01">Listing 1</A> shows the
+default operation policy, appropriately called "default", that is
+shipped with CUPS.</P>
+
+<P>The easiest way to add a policy to the <VAR>cupsd.conf</VAR>
+file is to use the web interface. Click on the
+<VAR>Administration</VAR> tab and then the <VAR>Edit
+Configuration File</VAR> button to edit the current
+<VAR>cupsd.conf</VAR> file. Click on the <VAR>Save Changes</VAR>
+button to save the changes and restart the scheduler. If you edit
+the <VAR>cupsd.conf</VAR> file from the console, make sure to <A
+HREF="ref-cupsd-conf.html">restart the cupsd process</A> before
+trying to use the new policy.</P>

+<H2 CLASS="title"><A NAME="SELECT">Using Policies</A></H2>
+
+<P>Once you have created a policy, you can use it in two ways.
+The first way is to assign it as the default policy for the
+system using the <A
+HREF="ref-cupsd-conf.html#DefaultPolicy"><TT>DefaultPolicy</TT></A>
+directive in the <VAR>cupsd.conf</VAR> file. For example, add the
+following line to the <VAR>cupsd.conf</VAR> file to use the
+"lab999" policy from the previous section:</P>
+
+<PRE CLASS="command">
+DefaultPolicy lab999
+</PRE>
+
+<P>To associate the policy with one or more printers, use either
+the <A HREF="man-lpadmin.html">lpadmin(8)</A> command or the web
+interface to change the operation policy for each printer. When
+using the <B>lpadmin</B> command, the <TT>-o
+printer-op-policy=name</TT> option sets the operation policy for
+a printer. For example, enter the following command to use the
+"lab999" policy from the previous section with a printer named
+"LaserJet4000":</P>
+
+<PRE CLASS="command">
+lpadmin -p LaserJet4000 -o printer-op-policy=lab999
+</PRE>
+
+<P>To make the same change in the web interface, go to the
+printer's web page, for example
+"http://localhost:631/printers/LaserJet4000", and click on the
+<VAR>Set Printer Options</VAR> button. Scroll down to the bottom
+of the page and choose the desired policy from the pull-down
+list. Click on <VAR>Save Changes</VAR> to change the policy for
+the printer.</P>
