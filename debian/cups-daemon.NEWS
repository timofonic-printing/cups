cups (1.7.1-6) unstable; urgency=low

  CUPS is now socket-activated when running under systemd as init: the
  daemon will be launched when needed and exit itself after being idle
  for some time (30 seconds by default).

  The delay before exiting on idle can be configured using
  'IdleExitTimeout' in /etc/cups/cupsd.conf. CUPS can also be left
  running continuously using 'SystemdIdleExit off' in that same file.
