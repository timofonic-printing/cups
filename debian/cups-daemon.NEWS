cups (2.1.4-2+) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  The default ErrorPolicy is changed from 'stop-printer' to 'retry-job',
  as this is a much less confusing default in most use-cases.

  The ErrorPolicy can be set globally in /etc/cups/cupsd.conf or
  per-printer, using the following command:
      lpadmin -p printername -o printer-error-policy=stop-printer

cups (1.7.5-7) unstable; urgency=medium

  CUPS can now be socket-activated when running under systemd as init, but
  isn't by default; if configured to do so, it can automatically exit itself
  after being idle for some time (30 seconds by default) by using the
  'SystemdIdleExit on' stanza in /etc/cups/cupsd.conf.
