cups (1.7.1-8) unstable; urgency=medium

  CUPS is now socket-activated when running under systemd as init: this
  impacts the usual ways of managing a cups daemon instance in two ways:

  - Configuration of the listening ports of CUPS
    CUPS opens its listening ports based on 'Port' and 'Listen' stanzas in
    /etc/cups/cupsd.conf. When options for remote access are modified through
    the webinterface at http://localhost:631, CUPS will write a systemd socket
    configuration file (see systemd.socket(5) ) in
    /etc/cups/cupsd-systemd-listen.conf, which is by default symlinked as
    cups-listen.conf in the /etc/systemd/system/cups.socket.d/ directory. For
    systemd's socket activation to keep working, cups.socket needs to be
    configured to listen to the correct IPs and ports. That automatic setup
    can be disabled by deleting the symlink and enhanced by dropping other
    files in the /etc/systemd/system/cups.socket.d/ directory.

  - Automatic exit when idle
    When operated under systemd as init, the CUPS daemon will be launched when
    needed (through socket activation) and exit itself after being idle for
    some time (30 seconds by default). The delay before exiting on idle can be
    configured using 'IdleExitTimeout' in /etc/cups/cupsd.conf. CUPS can also
    be left running continuously using 'SystemdIdleExit off' in that same file.
