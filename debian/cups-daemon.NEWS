cups (1.7.5-6+) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  CUPS can now be socket-activated when running under systemd as init, but
  isn't by default; if configured to do so, it can automatically exit itself
  after being idle for some time (30 seconds by default) by using the
  'SystemdIdleExit on' stanza in /etc/cups/cupsd.conf.
